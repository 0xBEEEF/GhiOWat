Contains tools to make working with the Open Watcom compiler in Ghidra easier

# About
In the 90s, the Watcom compiler was a quasi-industry standard. It was used for both ordinary applications and games. Because of this fact there is still a lot of old software written with it. So far the support in Ghidra for the Open Watcom compiler is rather poor. This is why this repository was originally created, with the idea to support the standard calling conventions of this old compiler. 

So far only the x86 calling conventions are supported.

Please note: All specifications refer purely to the Open Watcom compiler. It is possible that it also works with older versions, which exist before the open source release. However, this is not guaranteed. Just try it out, maybe it will work.
